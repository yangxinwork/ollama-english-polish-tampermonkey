# ollama-english-polish-tampermonkey
Local AI English Polisher is a Tampermonkey userscript that grabs your current text selection, sends it to a local Ollama Qwen2.5 instance for polishing, and shows the improved version in-place. It supports draggable UI, safe selection handling, and copy/apply actions without exposing your text to the cloud.
